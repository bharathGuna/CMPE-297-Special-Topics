# Assignment 5: Meta learning and multi task learning

## Part A
Implement reptile MAML algorithm for meta learning on a small dataset from scratch
- I used the cifar10 dataset to implement reptile algo

## Part B
Implement MMoE multi task learning model from scratch
- I used a synthesised dataset for MMoe multi task learning. 

## Part C
Do a hello world continual learning model with omniglot data set using the  avalanche continual learning framework 
- I used Avalanche and used the omniglot dataset to do the training.
